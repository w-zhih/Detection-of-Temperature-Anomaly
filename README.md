# Detection of Temperature Anomaly

The file data.mat in src gives the daily average temperature measurements from 150 weather stations in all 50 states for 31 days in March 2015, along with the geographical location of the stations (latitude and longitude). Suppose there is a sensor anomaly at one weather station on a given day (the average temperature recorded is several degrees warmer than the true value). Design an algorithm to detect the anomalous station number with the highest possible success rate.

Raw data from the National Weather Database website: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov .
